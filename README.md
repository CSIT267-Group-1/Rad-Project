The goal of this project is to create and application for use in the Radiology department of The Community College of Baltimore County for students to study with and take a quiz about the anatomy of the large intestine during a Barium Enema.

The application with contain multiple views of a Barium Enema. The user will be able to choose which view to look at. The views will display multiple information about the anatomy of the large intestine when it is filled with Barium. Labels, which can be turned on and off, will be used to name each area for the user to study.

A quiz mode will be included that will allow the user to test their knowledge about the anatomy. The quiz will be at most ten questions and will not allow the user to exit without completion. Results will be able to be sent to the teacher after the quiz.
